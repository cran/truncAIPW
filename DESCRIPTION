Description: Doubly robust estimation for the mean of an arbitrarily transformed survival time under covariate-induced dependent left truncation and noninformative right censoring. The functions truncAIPW(), truncAIPW_cen1(), and truncAIPW_cen2() compute the doubly robust estimators under the scenario without censoring and the two censoring scenarios, respectively. The package also contains three simulated data sets 'simu', 'simu_c1', and 'simu_c2', which are used to illustrate the usage of the functions in this package.
